# Neural Network from Scratch
In this little project we're going to program a neural network from scratch using python and libraries like numpy, scipy and matplotlib to plot the results and handle datasets.

The main element of a neural network is the **neuron**. A neuron is the element that receives values of our data and then processes those values as a ponderated sum. Finally the neuron delivers a more elaborated and complex result.

A Neural Network is the combination of a number of neurons that are organized in different layers. Each layer of neurons process information that will be delivered to the next neural layer and then to the next one and so on. 

The advatage of this, is that the neural network learns hierarchycal knowledge.

This is what is called _"deep learning"_ because if we have more and more layers, we can generate more complex results.

First we will plot the data we want to classify.

We will construct the structure of our neural network. Next we will train it with all the data and making the **_Backpropagation Algorithm_**.

And finally we will apply the **_Gradient Descent_** algorithm to optimize the cost function and thus classify correctly the data :)
